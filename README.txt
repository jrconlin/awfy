This is a crappy app.

I built this app as a learning experience for building FirefoxOS
webapps. This was my first attempt, and I'm quite sure that I did more
than a few things wrong. That said, I learned quite a bit and as is
the naiive nature of folks first learning this stuff, I'm making it
available for others to learn from.

This app is considered to be a "hosted" app, meaning that it's
generally run from a remote site. In this case, one of my domains. I
plan on writing up a blog post that talks about this app and the
lessons learned, but I did try to add notes and comments where I
could.
